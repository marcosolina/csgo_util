# RCON Rest API

This simple project allows me to send commands to the CSGO server that I use with my friends, I use [this library](https://github.com/koraktor/steam-condenser-java) to send the actual rcon command. This service exposes only one endpoint, where I send the CSGO credentials and the cmd that I want to execute.
