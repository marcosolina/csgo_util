# DEM Parser

I have created this project to parse the ".dem" files that are created by the CS:GO server that I use with my friends. It uses an external library to extract the information from the files.

## Dependencies

- [Library](https://github.com/StatsHelix/demoinfo): Library used to read the dem files
- [Rasp Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/iot/deployment#deploying-a-self-contained-app): I followed these instruction to build the project and run it on my Raspberry Pi
