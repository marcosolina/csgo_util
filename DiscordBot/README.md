# IxiGo Discord Bot

This project manages the Discord bot that we use when we play on our IxiGo server. It is a SpringBoot based on the [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) library.

## Bot Creation

- [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/): Go to the Discord developer portal and a bot in your server
- [Discord Permission Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html): Grant the follwing permission to the bot:
  - Read Messages
  - Send Messages
  - Move Members
- Intent: Go back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/), select your app and then the bot, now enable the "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT"

## Bot Commands

| Type | Response | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| !ping | !pong| Check if the bot is responsive |
