# Ixigo Discovery

This is a Spring Boot [Service Discovery](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/reference/html/#spring-cloud-eureka-server) where the different services will be registered. It is used to simplify the service to service (S2S) communication by providing a central place to retrive the list of the active services.
