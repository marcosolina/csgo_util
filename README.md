# CsGo Util

This is a personal project that I made to simplify couple of things when playing with my friends at CSGO. We play on our CSGO [dedicated server](https://github.com/marcosolina/csgo_server) and I wanted an easier way to issue RCON commands. I found [this nice library](https://github.com/Kronos666/rkon-core) which helps me to issue the commands that I need.
