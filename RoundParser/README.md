# Round Parser

I have created this project to parse the ".dem" files that are created by the CS:GO server that I use with my friends. It provides some functionalities that we use to generate the teams when we play a game.

## Dependencies

- [DemParser](https://github.com/marcosolina/csgo_util/tree/main/DemParser): It is used from one of the Java services to extract the information from the DEM files.

## Misc

- [API Documentation](https://marco.selfip.net/demparser/swagger-ui.html)
