# Web Page

This folder contains the files used to create the Web Page.

## Config

There are a couple of properties that you need to set:

- **PHP_BASE_URL**: This is an Environment Property that I use to retrieve the base url of the service that I have to call. I use this property to differenciate "local" and remote environment.
- **$demFilesRootFolder**: It points to the folder that contains the "dem" files, you have to set this property in the index.php file (around line 83)
- **$filesRootFolder**: It points to the folder that contains the "pictures" of the maps, you have to set this property in the index.php file (around line 84)
